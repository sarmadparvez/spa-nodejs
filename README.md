# Angular Express Application

This application shows real-time data for driver locations. Random drivers are generated whose
location is updated as per the set interval.

This project is a monorepo, and it contains two applications which are explained below.

## Angular

The frontend application shows visualizations of the real-time driver data i.e., in Table, Google Map, and JSON. The application is developed with Angular v14 and is available
in `apps/angular` directory. Overall this application demonstrates the following:

<ul>
  <li>Frontend development with Angular</li>
  <li>Reactive Programming (RxJs)</li>
  <li>Realtime data updates on user interface</li>
  <li>Consumption of REST API(s)</li>
  <li>Usage of socket client</li>
  <li>Usage of Angular Material components</li>
  <li>Standalone Angular Components</li>
  <li>Google Maps integration</li>
</ul>

## Express

The backend application is developed with Express.js using TypeScript and is available
in `apps/express` directory. The application generates random driver data. The driver [model](https://github.com/sarmadparvez/spa-nodejs/blob/main/libs/model/src/lib/driver.ts) is available
in the shared library which is used by both backend and frontend. The driver location is
randomly updated as per the set interval in [config.json](https://github.com/sarmadparvez/spa-nodejs/blob/main/apps/express/config.json) file.

The application exposes REST API to get driver data and also creates a
socket server to broadcast event to all connected clients whenever data is updated. Overall this application demonstrates the following:

<ul>
  <li>Backend development with Express using TypeScript</li>
  <li>Design and development of REST API(s)</li>
  <li>Socket server implementation</li>
  <li>Object-oriented programming and usage of design patterns</li>
  <li>Application architecture design</li>
</ul>

## Demo

Please visit [this](https://angular-drivers.web.app) for the project demo.

Note: When you will access the demo, the initial data load my take upto 20 seconds. This is because the backend express app is currently deployed on heroku which has a limitation that the service goes to sleep when not
in use for 30 minutes. Accessing the service wakes it up however the first request can take a longer time because
service is waking up, but further requests will be served immediately. If you run the applications locally, then you
will not face this limitation.

## Running the Applications

### Docker Containers

Both applications (Angular, Express) are dockerized and images are publicly available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com).

You must have docker installed to be able to run the applications in docker containers. Alternatively
you can also run the applications natively on your host operating system by following the instructions
in the next section (Development Server).

Simply run following command to pull the docker images, and run the Angular and Express applications in
docker containers.

`docker-compose up -d`

After the successful execution of above command:

To access the Angular app navigate to http://localhost:4200

To access the Express API make a GET call to http://localhost:3333/api/drivers

### Docker Images

To build the docker images locally (e.g, after updating code) run the following commands:

Angular: `docker build -t angular-drivers -f angular.Dockerfile .`

Express: `docker build -t drivers-express -f express.Dockerfile .`

Once the images are built you can run the applications in containers:

Angular: `docker run -d -it -p 4200:80/tcp --name angular-drivers angular-drivers`

Express: `docker run -d -it -p 3333:3333/tcp --name drivers-express drivers-express`

### Development Server

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). As a pre-requisite to run and build the applications in this monorepo you will need to install Nx cli
`npm install -g nx`

Before running the individual applications on the development server run `npm install`
to install the dependencies. As it is a monorepo and there is just one `package.json` , it will install the dependencies for all
applications.

#### Angular

Run `nx serve angular` for a dev server on port 4200. Navigate to http://localhost:4200. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Express

Run `nx serve express` for a dev server on port 3333. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The following REST API(s) are available:

1. Drivers Endpoint: GET http://localhost:3333/api/drivers
2. Update Interval: GET http://localhost:3333/api/update-interval (this is used by the frontend to show progress spinner).

## Building the Applications

Run `nx build angular` to build the angular project.

Run `nx build express` to build the angular project.

Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test angular` to execute the unit tests for angular app.

Run `nx test express` to execute the unit tests for express app.

The unit tests are executed via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Understand the workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
